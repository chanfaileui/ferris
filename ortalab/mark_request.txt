## Design Limitations

If you made any design decisions which you now regret making; but don't to go back and change them,
let us know here. You can make up your design marks by acknowledging up to 5 things you would do
differently now.

> - TODO
> I previously used GameResult<Vec<String>> to handle `--explain` which added unnecessary overhead to functions
> so I shifted towards using macros to handle explanations
> I apologise if I wasn't able to change the majority of instances due to the time constraints of the assignment
> some cloning + to_vec :( but only for small hands, it was mentioned in the forums that it's a relatively minor note

Also, I pass a placeholder and have Independent jokers simply ignore the card parameter
It really isn't the most pragmatic design but to refactor would mean setting up a JokerTarget enum
and excessive amounts of refactoring

placeholder card is honestly overkill for Independent jokers but I couldnt fix without significant refactoring
