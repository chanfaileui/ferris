## Design Limitations

If you made any design decisions which you now regret making; but don't to go back and change them,
let us know here. You can make up your design marks by acknowledging up to 5 things you would do
differently now.

> I previously used GameResult<Vec<String>> to store and handle `--explain` text which added unnecessary overhead to functions
> it also forced the functions to return explanantions even when it wasn't necessary
> so I shifted towards using print macros to handle explanations
> I apologise if I wasn't able to change the majority of instances due to the time constraints of the assignment

> quite a bit of cloning + to_vec :( but only for small hands, it was mentioned in the forums that it's a relatively minor note
> https://discourse02.cse.unsw.edu.au/25T1/COMP6991/t/using-clone/5319/8

> Also, I pass a placeholder card for one of my traits and have all Independent jokers ignore the "current_card" parameter
> It really isn't the most pragmatic design but to refactor would mean setting up a JokerTarget enum, or having two versions of apply
> and excessive amounts of refactoring.
